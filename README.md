for-neko
========

neko
The neko command will run a file which contains compiled Neko bytecode. If the file has a .n, you can omit it.
neko <bytecode_file>
Interpretive mode
To disable the JIT and only run interpreted code, use
neko -interp <bytecode_file>
Statistics
Some limited statistics are available using
neko -stats <bytecode_file>
This will print out how much time is spent in some functions and how many times they are called. It is mostly limited to C function calls.
nekoc
Compiling
The primary purpose of nekoc is to compile Neko code to Neko bytecode. It will output a file with the file’s extension replaced with .n.
nekoc <source_file>
Linking
Several bytecode files can be joined together into a single file.
nekoc -link <output_file_name> <bytecode_file> <bytecode_file> ...
This is very useful if you are planning on building a stand alone executable using nekotools.
Console
There is a read-execute-print loop available using nekoc. To use this, type in the code and then ! to execute it. The results will be shown.
nekoc -console
Note: local variables (declared with var) will not be kept in scope after the ! is used to execute the code.
Dumping bytecode
It can also dump the bytecode from a compiled file. It will output a file with .dump as the extension.
nekoc -d <bytecode_file>
Stripping bytecode
Debugging information and global names can be stripped from compiled bytecode. This is done in place, it does not create a new file.
nekoc -z <bytecode_file>
Prettifying code
nekoc can also create a properly formatted version of a source file. This command will create a new file. For example, if the source file is named “test.neko”, the new file will be called “test2.neko”.
nekoc -p <source_file>
Documentation
Documentation can be produced from comments in Neko source code. This will produce an HTML file.
nekoc -doc <source_file>
Options
Verbosity can be turned on with -v.
The output directory can be set with -o <directory>.
nekotools
Webserver
You can run a webserver that serves up pages using Neko code.
nekotools server
Options:
-h <domain> - set hostname
-p <port> - set port
-d <directory> - set base directory
-log <file> - set log file
-rewrite - activate pseudo mod-rewrite for smart urls
URLs will be matched to .n files in the server directory. For example, http://localhost:2000/test/ will execute and display the results from test.n file, if it exists.
Standalone executable
It is possible to create standalone executables from Neko bytecode. Note, however, that you will probably still need libneko.so or libneko.dll unless they are statically linked to neko.
This will output an executable file with no extension.
nekotools boot <bytecode_file>
nekoml
This program compiles NekoML files.
nekoml <source_file>
